# Modsmith
Modsmith is a PocketMine-MP plugin that simplifies customization with resource packs.
This is useless as a standalone plugin but can be used by other plugins to create custom inventories and register blocks & items in one resource pack.

This simplifies the usage because the user doesn't have to download & install resource packs in order to have custom blocks and more.

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/HimmelKreis4865/ModSmith/wiki) for a detailed API Documentation and examples

## Features
 - Extensive Inventory API, that allows modifying a Chest GUI by adding...
   - components built in Components such as Texts, Images, Slots, Grids, custom Close Buttons and Custom Progress Bars
   - options to style every component the way you need it (size, offset, slot background, hover controls)
   - a simple structure: No need to learn Json UI

## Example plugins
 - [IronChests](https://github.com/HimmelKreis4865/IronChests/), the original Minecraft Java Edition mod brought to PocketMine-MP, that allows bigger chests and more storage

## Roadmap
 - ScrollViews (Work in progress)
 - Clickable Buttons
 - Updatable Texts that can change without reopening the inventory
