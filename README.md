# Modsmith
ModSmith is a PocketMine-MP plugin that helps plugin developers to simply integrate custom blocks, items, gui and more.
This simplifies the process of installing plugins, because the resource pack is generated at runtime and there is no need to download resource packs for every plugin.

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/HimmelKreis4865/ModSmith/wiki) for a detailed API Documentation and examples

## Features
 - Extensive Inventory API, that allows modifying a Chest GUI by adding...
   - components built in Components such as Texts, Images, Slots, Grids, custom Close Buttons and Custom Progress Bars
   - options to style every component the way you need it (size, offset, slot background, hover controls)
   - a simple structure: No need to learn Json UI

## Example plugins
 - [IronChests](https://github.com/HimmelKreis4865/IronChests/), the original Minecraft Java Edition mod brought to PocketMine-MP, that allows bigger chests and more storage

## Roadmap
 - ScrollViews (Work in progress)
 - Clickable Buttons
 - Updatable Texts that can change without reopening the inventory
 - ...and much more - feel free to add your ideas / bugs via issue or discord (himmelkreis4865)
