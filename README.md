# Modsmith
Modsmith is a PocketMine-MP plugin that simplifies customization with resource packs.
This is useless as a standalone plugin but can be used by other plugins to create custom inventories and register blocks & items in one resource pack.

This simplifies the usage because the user doesn't have to download & install resource packs in order to have custom blocks and more.

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/HimmelKreis4865/ModSmith/wiki) for a detailed API Documentation and examples
